## [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org) + [WASI](https://wasi.dev) tools for [Go](https://go.dev)

## About

This repository contains code to generate Go bindings for [Component Model](https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/) interfaces defined in [WIT](https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/design/wit.html) (WebAssembly Interface Type) files. The goal of this project is to accelerate adoption of the Component Model and development of [WASI 0.2+](https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/WASI-0.2) in Go.

### Component Model

Package [cm](./cm) contains helper types and functions used by generated packages, such as `option<t>`, `result<ok, err>`, `variant`, `list`, and `resource`. These are intended for use by generated [Component Model](https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/blob/main/design/mvp/Explainer.md#type-definitions) bindings, where the caller converts to a Go equivalent. It attempts to map WIT semantics to their equivalent in Go where possible.

#### Note on Memory Safety

Package `cm` and generated bindings from `wit-bindgen-go` may have compatibility issues with the Go garbage collector, as they directly represent `variant` and `result` types as tagged unions where a pointer shape may be occupied by a non-pointer value. The GC may detect and throw an error if it detects a non-pointer value in an area it expects to see a pointer. This is an area of active development.

## `wit-bindgen-go`

### WIT → Go

The `wit-bindgen-go` tool can generate Go bindings for WIT interfaces and worlds. If [`wasm-tools`](https://crates.io/crates/wasm-tools) is installed and in `$PATH`, then `wit-bindgen-go` can load WIT directly.

```sh
wit-bindgen-go generate ../wasi-cli/wit
```

Otherwise, pass the JSON representation of a fully-resolved WIT package:

```sh
wit-bindgen-go generate wasi-cli.wit.json
```

Or pipe via `stdin`:

```sh
wasm-tools component wit -j --all-features ../wasi-cli/wit | wit-bindgen-go generate
```

### JSON → WIT

For debugging purposes, `wit-bindgen-go` can also convert a JSON representation back into WIT. This is useful for validating that the intermediate representation faithfully represents the original WIT source.

```sh
wit-bindgen-go wit example.wit.json
```

### WIT → JSON

The [wit](./wit) package can decode a JSON representation of a fully-resolved WIT file. Serializing WIT into JSON requires [wasm-tools](https://crates.io/crates/wasm-tools) v1.210.0 or higher. To convert a WIT file into JSON, run `wasm-tools` with the `-j` argument:

```sh
wasm-tools component wit -j --all-features example.wit
```

This will emit JSON on `stdout`, which can be piped to a file or another program.

```sh
wasm-tools component wit -j --all-features example.wit > example.wit.json
```

## Contributing

Developing and testing `wit-bindgen-go` requires an up-to-date installation of [Go](https://go.dev), [TinyGo](https://tinygo.org), [Wasmtime](https://wasmtime.dev), and [`wasm-tools`](https://crates.io/crates/wasm-tools).

Unless you explicitly state otherwise, any contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in this project by you, as defined in the Apache-2.0 license, shall be licensed as above, without any additional terms or conditions.

### Testing

Tests are supported under both Go and TinyGo, on Linux, macOS, and WebAssembly.

```sh
go test ./...
tinygo test ./...
```

Testing with WebAssembly (`wasip1`) requires an installation of [`go_wasip1_wasm32_exec`](https://go.dev/blog/wasi) and [Wasmtime](https://wasmtime.dev). WASI 0.2 `wasip2` is supported under TinyGo version 0.33.0 or later.

```sh
GOARCH=wasm GOOS=wasip1 go test ./...
GOARCH=wasm GOOS=wasip1 tinygo test ./...
tinygo test -target=wasip2 ./... # requires TinyGo 0.33.0 or later
```

This package contains tests that validate the round-trip parsing and re-serialization of WIT files back into WIT. To rebuild the test files in the [testdata](./testdata) directory, run `make golden`. This will reregenerate the JSON intermediate representation and the equivalent `*.golden.wit` files.
